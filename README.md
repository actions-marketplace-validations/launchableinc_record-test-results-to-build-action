# Launchable record test results to build action

# Usage

By default, we suggest using the [record build and test results action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/record-build-and-test-results-action).

However if your code repository/repositories is/are not available in the step where you run tests, you can split up the two steps (record build and record tests).

Use the [Launchable record build action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/record-build-action) to record a build, then use this action to record tests against the build.

## Example

Refer to [go-test example](./.github/workflows/go-test-example.yaml) for example use of the action.

# Inputs

## Required

### `build_name`

[Build](https://docs.launchableinc.com/concepts/build) name that you can give to the current software. Default is the Git SHA revealed by GitHub Actions.

### `test_runner`

The name of your test runner. Our supported test runners are [here](https://www.launchableinc.com/docs/sending-data-to-launchable/using-ci-integrations/using-the-launchable-github-action/).

### `report_path`

Path to the test report(s) generated by your test runner. Refer to [here](https://www.launchableinc.com/docs/sending-data-to-launchable/using-ci-integrations/using-the-launchable-github-action/) for examples.

Note: Depending on your test runner, you might need to modify your test runner command to ensure it creates test reports that Launchable accepts per [this doc](https://www.launchableinc.com/docs/sending-data-to-launchable/using-ci-integrations/using-the-launchable-github-action/#update-your-test-runner-command).

## Optional

### `python_version`

Python version for the Launchable CLI to use. Default is `3.10`. Change this if your workflow requires a specific Python version.
